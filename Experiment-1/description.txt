In this experiment we have just simply made a interface of registration form , where we add the 
validations and also run that validations . First one is that our page is working propely or not 
then other one like what constraints we have input in our index.html file name,e-mail, age
and some of the validations and also seeing that these validation are able to work in our form 
or not(by checking the validationsthet we have added into thses constraints are minlenght 
,maxlenght,required, min ) . In style.css file  we have designed the background theme for 
the form or how it look like in that we also add some constraints like  background colour,
 width,height, padding,marginal,display, flex-direction. In the body of the form we have
add the background colour,flex-direction,justify_content, align_content and also we have
 check the default flex-direction of our form look - like (row and column) then its also 
 changing the interace according to our prefernce but by default it is in the row formation
.So now are form is in the working conditions after aproving all the conditions or we can 
say all the validation approval has been done .
