In this experiment we have make a banking  interface in which we use index.html and style.css 
file and also style the interface by adding different constraints, and also made the <div> tag
in which making classes ("outer-container" , "inner-container" and "balance-section h2")  and
button element ( repersent a button labelled by its content). In which made two options
"depoist" and "withdraw".There we have add different constraints in the outer-container and
inner-container like height ,width ,background colour ,justify-content(to justify the position
of the box or teh output) , padding and marginal also used for outer-container  and then add 
the description for the style of button (about its shape ) , then add the background colour
for the button that has been named as deposit and withdraw and also add the  font size used
in the banking interface that we have made.
